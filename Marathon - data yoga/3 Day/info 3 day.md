# Marathon 3 day

Tableau marathon - 42 days of practice from [DataYoga](https://tableau.pro/bookofmarathon42)

[**2 day**](https://tableau.pro/m03)

Today we have new data - projects published on Kickstarter from 2009 to 2016 (not all projects). We only work with the date of project registration.
It's time to talk about time. Time in data gives us insight into the history and course of events, and color embellishes them. In this assignment, we work with color and time.

**About the dataset.**
Projects published on Kickstarter from 2009 to 2016 (not all projects)

Tasks:
1. In which quarter and in which year the most projects were registered
2. What day of the week is the best day to register a project? (number of projects with "successful" status)
3. When (date) of all projects was the maximum amount of planned collection (Goal) and collected (Pledged) in the U.S.
4. Which category has the most "successful" projects in Australia and Canada?
5. Which country saw the largest increase in Usd Pledged for projects in 2016 compared to 2015?

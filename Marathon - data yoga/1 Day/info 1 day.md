# Marathon 1 day

Tableau marathon - 42 days of practice from [DataYoga](https://tableau.pro/bookofmarathon42)

[**1 day**](https://tableau.pro/m01)

Using data about Olympic results for the last 120 years as an example, we'll understand the Tableau workspace, build bar charts, and, using different kinds of sorting, find the answers in the data.
**About the dataset.**
A list of Olympic results by the following characteristics: athletes, medals, sport, year and place. To display the number of athletes we will use the Number of records automatically generated Tableau (in our case, the number of all athletes and their results for 120 years of the history of the Games).

Tasks:
1. Determine the total number of athletes in the history of the Games.
2. Which Olympic Games have had the greatest number of athletes?
3. In which Olympic Games was Finland represented by the greatest number of athletes?
4. Have athletes from Egypt participated in the Winter Games and when?
5. Have athletes from Fiji won gold medals: when and what sports?
6. The oldest Olympian and his/her age?
7. Which teams won medals in ice hockey during the Summer Olympics, where and in what year?
8. At which games were there more female athletes on the Dutch team than male athletes?

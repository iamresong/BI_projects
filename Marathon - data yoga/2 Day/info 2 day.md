# Marathon 2 day

Tableau marathon - 42 days of practice from [DataYoga](https://tableau.pro/bookofmarathon42)

[**2 day**](https://tableau.pro/m01)

Using data about Olympic results for the last 120 years as an example, we'll understand the Tableau workspace, build bar charts, and, using different kinds of sorting, find the answers in the data.
**About the dataset.**
A list of Olympic results by the following characteristics: athletes, medals, sport, year and place. To display the number of athletes we will use the Number of records automatically generated Tableau (in our case, the number of all athletes and their results for 120 years of the history of the Games).

Tasks:
1. Which Olympic Games attracted the most athletes? (line chart)
2. Which Olympics (winter and summer) produced the most gold medals?
3. Which Olympics (winter and summer) had the lowest (average) height of athletes?
4. From which year did the Olympics begin alternating?
5. How many gold medals has the Zimbabwean team won in the history of the game? (area chart)
6. When did women begin competing in water polo?
7. Who was the lightest athlete on the Australian team in all the games?
And as always, the mighty tooltip or contextual mien of the magical View Data will help answer the questions
